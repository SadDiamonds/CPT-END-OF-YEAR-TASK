# Launchers

We recommend running the game from Terminal. From the project root:

```bash
cd /path/to/CPT-END-OF-YEAR-TASK
python3 main.py
```

If you prefer the provided launchers, run them from Terminal instead of double-clicking:

- Windows: `run_game_win.bat` (run with `cmd /c run_game_win.bat`)
- macOS: `run_game_mac.command` (run with `sh run_game_mac.command`)
