# Launchers

Pick the launcher that matches your operating system and double-click it:

- **run_game_win.bat** – Windows 10/11 (opens `python main.py` from the project root)
- **run_game_mac.command** – macOS (uses `python3 main.py` from the project root)

Need another OS? run `python main.py` manually from the repository root.
