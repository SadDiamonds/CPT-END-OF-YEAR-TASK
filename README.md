# CPT END OF YEAR TASK

![title](ascii-art-text.png)

## Instructions:

1. Unzip the download.
2. Open the new `launchers/` folder.
3. Double-click `run_game_win.bat` on **Windows** or `run_game_mac.command` on **macOS**.
4. Prefer Linux / custom setups? Run `python main.py` (or `python3 main.py`) from the project root.

Fullscreen is optional—toggle `AUTO_FULLSCREEN` inside `config.py` if you want the old forced-behaviour back.
